Things We need to Alter in this version:

We have found out that all we need is to make the prediction of the stock through RDL. This means that we will have to do several changes.
1. No need to make the split of training, testing and validation nor to create a 3 environments. Instead we will use only one
2. In the NN architecture there is no need for the Policy or Value head. Only the prediction head.
3. We will use the data collected before on major parts like (hidden_size = 45	lambda_pred = 0.5	drop_out = 0	Normalize (Z_score)) to start better
training process. I will use ML analysis to get the results.
4. The function should return the TPG signature for us to be able to Use the function to Draw and save the thing
5. I will abandon the old API of Saving and Logging. Only the essentials no need for other details.
6. I will make the NN head bigger than before.


Do what is only required in the task
He has 2 parts of data only   Train- Fitted  --> Test - Forcast
