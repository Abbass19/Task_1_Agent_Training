MAPE TRIALS 
At 0.7 ratio

Manipulated Variable :	
	1. NN size (64, 128, 256, 512)
	2. Loss Functions (MSE, MAPE)
	3. Split Ratio (0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.85)

Responding Variable: 
	1. Scalar Initial Error
	2. Error across changing function


We reached a conclusion through some experimentation that we don't have an easy solution. 
I mistakenly thought that I got very good results. However I reached a certainty that 
there is no easy trick and that trade situation needs the usage of an hyperparameter tuning function. 
We got out of confusion and Illusion and for me this is good result.
